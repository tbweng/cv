abstract = {PURPOSE To increase understanding about the effects of moderate-intensity physical activity on cognitive function, the current study examined whether a single bout of aerobic exercise exerts differential effects on distinct aspects of executive function in healthy young adults. METHODS A within-subjects study was designed where 26 young adult participants (mean age = 25.23 yr, 12 males) engaged in a 30-min bout of both (a) moderate-intensity aerobic cycling and (b) passive motor-driven cycling, occurring on two separate occasions and counterbalanced in their order. To assess changes in cognitive function, performance on two tasks of executive function-working memory and inhibitory control, counterbalanced in the order of administration-was collected before and immediately after each exercise session. RESULTS Results indicate that working memory performance on the 2-back condition of a facial n-back task was acutely enhanced by moderate-intensity exercise (mean increase in accuracy = 6.4% ± 1.1%), which was significantly greater than the changes after passive exercise control (P < 0.05). This finding was not observed for inhibitory control in which neither of the exercise sessions elicited significant changes in performance on a flanker task. CONCLUSIONS Acute aerobic exercise evokes differential effects on executive functions. This specificity in behavioral outcomes leads to the prediction that brain mechanisms related to working memory, compared to inhibitory control, are selectively benefited by moderate-intensity exercise.},

abstract = {Greater physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with reduced age-related cognitive decline and lower risk for dementia. However, significant gaps remain in the understanding of how physical activity and fitness protect the brain from adverse effects of brain aging. The primary goal of the current study was to empirically evaluate the independent relationships between physical activity and fitness with functional brain health among healthy older adults, as measured by the functional connectivity of cognitively and clinically relevant resting state networks. To build context for fitness and physical activity associations in older adults, we first demonstrate that young adults have greater within-network functional connectivity across a broad range of cortical association networks. Based on these results and previous research, we predicted that individual differences in fitness and physical activity would be most strongly associated with functional integrity of the networks most sensitive to aging. Consistent with this prediction, and extending on previous research, we showed that cardiorespiratory fitness has a positive relationship with functional connectivity of several cortical networks associated with age-related decline, and effects were strongest in the default mode network (DMN). Furthermore, our results suggest that the positive association of fitness with brain function can occur independent of habitual physical activity. Overall, our findings provide further support that cardiorespiratory fitness is an important factor in moderating the adverse effects of aging on cognitively and clinically relevant functional brain networks.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that aerobic exercise protects against age-related cognitive decline, and that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an important factor for these benefits. Studies also suggest that combining physical activity with cognitive enrichment is beneficial. We further examine these predictions by comparing effects of a nutritional supplement promoting exercise capacity to a lower intensity activity with cognitive enrichment on functional network and cognitive outcomes that otherwise decline with aging. Inactive healthy older adults were randomized to one of four groups including a low-intensity activity with complex cognitive demands (DANCE), walking, walking+supplement, or an active-control. Results showed walking+supplement increased Salience Network functional connectivity (FC), with less training benefit for Default Mode Network FC. Although cognitive performance did not increase for any training group, participants in the walking+supplement group who were on medication that boosted key neurotransmitters (e.g., SSRIs) showed improved processing speed. Overall, this study provides new insight into how to boost the protective effects of exercise on brain systems that otherwise deteriorate with aging.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Previous studies report memory and functional connectivity of memory systems improve acutely after a single aerobic exercise session or with training, suggesting that the acute effects of aerobic exercise may reflect initial changes that adapt over time. In this trial, for the first time, we test the proof-of-concept of whether the acute and training effects of aerobic exercise on working memory and brain network connectivity are related in the same participants. METHODS Cognitively normal older participants (N = 34) were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial (NCT02453178). Participants completed fMRI resting state and a face working memory N-back task acutely after light- and moderate-intensity exercises and after a 12-wk aerobic training intervention. RESULTS Functional connectivity did not change more after moderate-intensity training compared with light-intensity training. However, both training groups showed similar changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (maximal exercise oxygen uptake, V˙O2peak), limiting group-level comparisons. Acute effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on connections primarily in the default network predicted training enhancements in the same connections. Working memory also improved acutely, especially after moderate-intensity, and greater acute improvements predicted greater working memory improvement with training. Exercise effects on functional connectivity of right lateralized frontoparietal connections were related to both acute and training gains in working memory. CONCLUSIONS Our data support the concept of acute aerobic exercise effects on functional brain systems and performance as an activity-evoked biomarker for exercise training benefits in the same outcomes. These findings may lead to new insights and methods for improving memory outcomes with aerobic exercise training.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Declining episodic memory is common among otherwise healthy older adults, in part due to negative effects of aging on hippocampal circuits. However, there is significant variability between individuals in severity of aging effects on the hippocampus and subsequent memory decline. Importantly, variability may be influenced by modifiable protective physiological factors such as cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). More research is needed to better understand which aspects of cognition that decline with aging benefit most from CRF. The current study evaluated the relation of CRF with learning rate on the episodic associative learning (EAL) task, a task designed specifically to target hippocampal-dependent relational binding and to evaluate learning with repeated occurrences. Results show higher CRF was associated with faster learning rate. Larger hippocampal volume was also associated with faster learning rate, though hippocampal volume did not mediate the relationship between CRF and learning rate. Furthermore, to support the distinction between learning item relations and learning higher-order sequences, which declines with aging but is largely reliant on extra-hippocampal learning systems, we found learning rate on the EAL task was not related to motor sequence learning on the alternating serial reaction time task. Motor sequence learning was also not correlated with hippocampal volume. Thus, for the first time, we show that both higher CRF and larger hippocampal volume in healthy older adults are related to enhanced rate of relational memory acquisition.},

abstract = {Musical practice, including musical training and musical performance, has been found to benefit cognitive function in older adults. Less is known about the role of musical experiences on brain structure in older adults. The present study examined the role of different types of musical behaviors on brain structure in older adults. We administered the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index, a questionnaire that includes questions about a variety of musical behaviors, including performance on an instrument, musical practice, allocation of time to music, musical listening expertise, and emotional responses to music. We demonstrated that musical training, defined as the extent of musical training, musical practice, and musicianship, was positively and significantly associated with the volume of the inferior frontal cortex and parahippocampus. In addition, musical training was positively associated with volume of the posterior cingulate cortex, insula, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Together, the present study suggests that musical behaviors relate to a circuit of brain regions involved in executive function, memory, language, and emotion. As gray matter often declines with age, our study has promising implications for the positive role of musical practice on aging brain health.},
